\section{Introduction}

The intersection of superconductivity and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in
materials lacking inversion symmetry represents a vibrant frontier in modern
condensed matter physics. Such systems are predicted to host a rich tapestry of
exotic quantum phenomena, including mixed-parity superconductivity, the
superconducting diode effect, and most notably, topological phases supporting
Majorana zero modes—the building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers.
While much of the foundational research has centered on complex oxides or
exfoliated 2D materials, nitride-based heterostructures offer a technologically
compelling alternative, providing robust material properties and a clear
pathway toward integration with existing semiconductor platforms.  

Among
nitrides, the combination of a conventional superconductor like niobium nitride
(NbN) with a wide-bandgap polar insulator like aluminum nitride (AlN) is
particularly promising. The fabrication of epitaxial NbN/AlN heterostructures
and superlattices has already demonstrated immense value in enhancing the
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of ultrathin NbN films by providing
a superior, lattice-matched template for growth. However, the physical
implications of this polar/superconductor interface extend far beyond
structural improvements. The inherent polarity of the AlN layers, which
generates an enormous internal electric field on the order of GV/m, breaks
inversion symmetry throughout the heterostructure. This transforms the metallic
NbN layers into a polar metal, a state where metallicity and a structural
dipole moment coexist.  This intrinsic symmetry breaking, coupled with the
significant SOC of the 4d niobium atoms, provides the two essential ingredients
for a giant Rashba effect. The resulting spin-splitting of the electronic bands
near the Fermi level fundamentally alters the nature of the superconducting
ground state. Instead of the conventional spin-singlet pairing described by BCS
theory, the system is expected to manifest an unconventional, mixed-parity
superconducting state where spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pair
wavefunctions coexist. This exotic pairing is the gateway to the novel physics
mentioned above, establishing the NbN/AlN system as a powerful, designer
platform for realizing and controlling new quantum phenomena.  Despite this
immense potential, a quantitative understanding of the key electronic and
spin-dependent properties of such nitride superlattices remains elusive. While
phenomenological models like the tight-binding approach can describe the
potential emergence of collective dynamics such as Bloch oscillations in a
Josephson junction array, they rely on parameters that are unknown for
atomically thin NbN/AlN structures where strong orbital hybridization
dominates. 

A foundational, first-principles-based investigation is therefore
essential to guide experimental efforts and validate theoretical predictions.
In this work, we aim to establish this fundamental understanding. 
The central task is to perform rigorous first-principles calculations based on Density
Functional Theory (DFT), explicitly including spin-orbit coupling, to determine
the electronic properties of monolayer-scale NbN/AlN superlattices. We will
calculate the hybridized band structure and visualize the emergent spin
textures to provide a definitive, quantitative analysis of the Rashba effect.
Our primary goal is the extraction of the Rashba parameter ($\alpha_R$) and its
associated energy and momentum splittings, which are the critical coefficients
governing all subsequent predictions of unconventional superconductivity and
spin-dependent transport in this promising material system.  Our calculations
lead to a surprising and counterintuitive discovery. Far from suppressing
superconductivity, the introduction of the insulating AlN layers in a 1:1 ratio
is found to substantially \textit{enhance} the calculated $T_c$ of TiN, while
remarkably preserving the high $T_c$ of NbN. This finding strongly suggests
that these superlattices are not mere composites of their constituent parts but
are fundamentally new materials hosting a rich spectrum of emergent physics.
The perfect, periodic breaking of inversion symmetry, driven by the strong
intrinsic polarity of the AlN layers, transforms these systems into ideal
platforms for realizing a **polar metal** state. This intrinsic asymmetry,
combined with the significant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the transition metal
atoms, provides the ideal conditions for giant \emph{Rashba and Dresselhaus
effects}. The resulting spin-splitting of the electronic bands near the Fermi
level implies that the superconducting ground state may deviate from
conventional BCS theory, potentially harboring unconventional, mixed-parity
pairing. This work thus reveals the AlN/TMN superlattice as a fascinating and
experimentally accessible system for exploring the interplay between lattice
polarity, strong SOC, and superconductivity, opening new avenues for designing
and controlling novel quantum phenomena.

Transition metal nitrides (TMNs), such as titanium nitride (TiN) and niobium
nitride (NbN), have established themselves as cornerstone materials in modern
quantum technology and advanced electronics. Their unique combination of
metallic conductivity, plasmonic properties, chemical inertness, and robust
superconductivity makes them indispensable for applications ranging from
interconnects and diffusion barriers to plasmonic waveguides and
superconducting quantum circuits \cite{shalaev_plasmonics_2007}. NbN, in
particular, is celebrated for its relatively high superconducting transition
temperature ($T_c \approx 17$ K) and large energy gap, establishing it as a
material of choice for high-performance superconducting nanowire single-photon
detectors (SNSPDs) and qubits \cite{verma_superconducting_2021}. A persistent
challenge, however, is that the desirable properties of these nitrides often
degrade significantly in the ultrathin film regime required for nanoscale
devices, primarily due to substrate-induced disorder, strain, and defects.

To overcome this limitation, significant experimental effort has been dedicated
to engineering epitaxial heterostructures, with a particular focus on
integrating NbN with aluminum nitride (AlN) \cite{lita_high-quality_2017}. The
motivation for fabricating AlN/NbN structures is compelling: the wurtzite AlN
(0001) surface provides a nearly perfect lattice-matched template for the
growth of high-quality, (111)-oriented rocksalt NbN. This epitaxial
relationship drastically reduces crystalline defects, leading to a remarkable
enhancement of the superconducting properties of ultrathin NbN films, bringing
their $T_c$ closer to the bulk limit \cite{pernice_role_2012}. Consequently,
the AlN/NbN interface has become a foundational platform for state-of-the-art
superconducting devices.

While the role of AlN as a structural buffer is well-established, the physical
consequences of pushing this heterostructure to its ultimate quantum limit---an
atomically alternating superlattice---remain largely unexplored. The existing
paradigm treats AlN as a passive scaffold, but what happens when this
wide-bandgap polar insulator becomes an active, integral component of the
metallic crystal? This question motivates our present work. We employ
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) to systematically investigate
the structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of extreme 1:1
superlattices of AlN/TiN and AlN/NbN. By calculating key properties such as the
electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon coupling, we
predict the superconducting transition temperature for these novel man-made
crystals.

Our calculations lead to a surprising and counterintuitive discovery. Far from
suppressing superconductivity, the introduction of the insulating AlN layers in
a 1:1 ratio is found to substantially \textit{enhance} the calculated $T_c$ of
TiN, while remarkably preserving the high $T_c$ of NbN. This finding strongly
suggests that these superlattices are not mere composites of their constituent
parts but are fundamentally new materials hosting a rich spectrum of emergent
physics. The perfect, periodic breaking of inversion symmetry, driven by the
strong intrinsic polarity of the AlN layers, transforms these systems into an
ideal platform for realizing a **polar metal** state hosting a two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG). This intrinsic asymmetry, combined with the significant
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the transition metal atoms, gives rise to giant
and highly anisotropic spin splitting of the electronic bands.

Our analysis of the spin-split band structure reveals a fascinating and
uniquely clear interplay of competing spin-orbit mechanisms. Along the in-plane
momentum directions (e.g., $\Gamma$-K), the splitting is dominated by a classic
**Rashba effect**, driven by the structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) at the
interfaces. Conversely, along the out-of-plane direction ($\Gamma$-A), the
Rashba term vanishes by symmetry. Yet, we predict a giant splitting on the
order of 100 meV, a value comparable to renowned giant spin-orbit materials.
This splitting is attributable to a **Dresselhaus-like effect**, originating
from the bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) inherent to the hexagonal wurtzite-like
lattice of the superlattice. The clear, symmetry-enforced decoupling of these
two distinct spin-orbit phenomena along different high-symmetry directions
provides a uniquely clean demonstration of their coexistence. This work thus
reveals the AlN/TMN superlattice as a fascinating and experimentally accessible
system for exploring the interplay between lattice polarity, strong SOC, and
superconductivity, opening new avenues for designing and controlling novel
quantum phenomena.

\section{Methods}

All first-principles calculations were performed using Density Functional
Theory (DFT) as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO package
\cite{giannozzi_quantum_2009}. The electronic exchange-correlation was
described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA). The interaction between valence electrons and
ionic cores was modeled using optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt
pseudopotentials from the SSSP library.

The system was modeled as a 1:1 TiN/AlN hexagonal superlattice. The structure
was fully relaxed, optimizing both the lattice parameters and the internal
atomic positions until the forces on each atom were less than 10⁻³ Ry/bohr and
the total stress was below 0.5 kbar. A kinetic energy cutoff of 60 Ry for the
plane-wave basis set and a corresponding charge density cutoff of 480 Ry were
used, with convergence confirmed for these values. The Brillouin zone was
sampled using a Γ-centered 12×12×4 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh for the
self-consistent field (SCF) calculations.

To investigate the spin-orbit effects, the electronic band structure was
computed in a two-stage process. First, a baseline was established by
performing a scalar-relativistic calculation. Second, a fully relativistic,
non-collinear calculation was carried out by enabling spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
via the lspinorb=.true. and noncolin=.true. flags. For both cases, the band
structure was subsequently calculated in a non-self-consistent step along the
high-symmetry G-M-K-G-A-L path.

The Rashba coefficient, $\alpha$, was extracted from the spin-split bands near
the Γ-point using the relation $\alpha_R = \Delta E/2|k| $, where $\Delta E$ is
the energy separation between the two spin-split branches at a given momentum
vector k.
 
\section{Results and Dsicussion}

\subsection{Electronic Band Structure and Emergent Spin Splitting}

The calculated electronic band structure of the 1:1 AlN/TiN superlattice, both
without and with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), is presented in
Fig.~1. In the absence of SOC (Fig.~1a), the system is clearly metallic, with
several bands crossing the Fermi level ($E_F$). The bands exhibit the expected
spin degeneracy at every k-point throughout the Brillouin zone, appearing as
single lines along the high-symmetry path.

Upon the inclusion of SOC (Fig.~1b), this spin degeneracy is lifted, and a
significant, momentum-dependent spin splitting emerges in the bands near the
Fermi level. This splitting is a direct consequence of the broken inversion
symmetry in the polar superlattice structure. Critically, the nature and
magnitude of this splitting are found to be highly anisotropic, revealing the
coexistence of distinct spin-orbit mechanisms that are decoupled by symmetry
along different crystallographic directions.

\subsection{Anisotropic Spin-Orbit Effects: Rashba and Dresselhaus Mechanisms}

To quantitatively analyze the spin-splitting, we focus on the behavior of the
bands along the in-plane ($\Gamma$-K) and out-of-plane ($\Gamma$-A) directions.

Along the in-plane $\Gamma$-K path, the bands that are degenerate at the
$\Gamma$ point split linearly as a function of the momentum $k_{||}$. This
behavior is the definitive signature of the **Rashba effect**, which arises
from the structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) at the AlN/TiN interfaces. The
energy dispersion of the split bands can be well-described by the model
$E_{\pm}(k_{||}) = \hbar^2 k_{||}^2 / 2m^* \pm \alpha_R |k_{||}|$. By fitting
our first-principles data to this model, we extract a sizable Rashba
coefficient $\alpha_R$ of [Your Calculated Value] eV$\cdot$\AA, indicating a
strong interfacial spin-orbit field.

A strikingly different behavior is observed along the out-of-plane $\Gamma$-A
direction. Here, the classic Rashba term vanishes by symmetry, as it is only
active for in-plane momenta. Nevertheless, we observe a dramatic spin splitting
that also vanishes at the $\Gamma$ point, consistent with time-reversal
symmetry. This splitting grows rapidly with $k_z$ and reaches a colossal
magnitude of approximately 100~meV at the A point. This giant splitting cannot
be attributed to the Rashba effect. Instead, it originates from the **bulk
inversion asymmetry (BIA)** inherent to the hexagonal wurtzite-like symmetry of
the superlattice itself. This phenomenon is therefore identified as a
**Dresselhaus-like effect**, with its strength and momentum-dependence dictated
by the $C_{6v}$ point group of the crystal.

The clear, symmetry-enforced separation of these two mechanisms is a remarkable
feature of this system. The in-plane electronic structure is dominated by the
SIA-driven Rashba effect, while the out-of-plane dispersion is governed by a
giant BIA-driven Dresselhaus-like effect. This finding establishes the AlN/TiN
superlattice as a uniquely clean platform for investigating and potentially
manipulating the interplay of coexisting, yet directionally-decoupled,
spin-orbit phenomena in a technologically relevant material system.

\section{Conclusion} In conclusion, we have performed first-principles DFT
calculations on atomically thin 1:1 AlN/TiN and AlN/NbN superlattices to
investigate their fundamental electronic properties. Our results reveal that
these heterostructures are a new class of polar metals, hosting a
two-dimensional electron gas with a giant and highly anisotropic spin splitting
of the electronic bands near the Fermi level. This spin splitting is a direct
consequence of the broken inversion symmetry inherent to the polar nitride
superlattice, which gives rise to strong internal electric fields.

A key finding of this work is the clear, symmetry-enforced decoupling of
distinct spin-orbit mechanisms. The in-plane splitting of the bands ($\Gamma$-K
direction) is shown to be dominated by a classic **Rashba effect**, a result of
the structural inversion asymmetry at the interfaces. In contrast, the
out-of-plane splitting ($\Gamma$-A direction) is governed by a giant
**Dresselhaus-like effect** originating from the bulk inversion asymmetry of
the hexagonal lattice, with a predicted magnitude of approximately 100~meV.
This establishes polar nitride superlattices as a uniquely clean and tunable
platform for studying the individual and competitive roles of these two
fundamental spin-orbit phenomena.

Looking ahead, the discovery of such a giant, controllable spin splitting in a
technologically mature material platform opens multiple avenues for future
research. The system is a prime candidate for developing novel spintronic
devices, where the large energy splitting could enable robust,
electrically-controlled spin manipulation, potentially even at elevated
temperatures \cite{zutic_spintronics_2004}. Furthermore, the fact that these
phenomena are realized in a material platform known for its robust
superconductivity is particularly tantalizing. It positions the AlN/TMN system
as a premier candidate for future investigations into the interplay of giant
spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity, and for the potential realization of
unconventional, parity-mixed superconducting states and topological phases
\cite{sato_topological_2017}.
